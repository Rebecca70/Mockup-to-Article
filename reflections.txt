You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  1) What new skills have you learned?
  2) What has been easy?
  3) What has been difficult?
  4) How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

1)  I've learned a few new HTML elements (e.g. <strong>, <sup> etc.). Additionally, I learned about absolute vs relative paths.
    Even if I knew about MDN I was able to practice the use of it.
2)  Since I already did the IPND I had some basic knowledge. Therefore most was fairly easy.
3)  At first I was a bit confused about absolute vs relative paths, but I think I understood it now. Additionally,
    I was struggling a bit with GitHub since it was the first time that I used it in 'real' life.
4)  I was using the web often, mainly MDN.
